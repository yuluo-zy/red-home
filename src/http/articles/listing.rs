    // touch all matching rows--not exactly an efficient process.

    // This combined with the limit/offset parameters suggests the design uses an old-fashioned
    // pagination style with page numbers and uses this number to calculate
    // the total number of pages. (Disclaimer: I have not actually looked at the frontend
    // design to be sure; this is just an educated guess.)
    //
    // Modern applications don't really do this anymore and instead implement some sort
    // of infinite scrolling scheme which plays better with paginating based on the value
    // of a column like described on `limit`/`offset` above.

    // they're on. If they're searching for something, they're going to give up if it's
    // not in the first few results anyway. If they're just browsing then they
    // don't usually care where they are in the total ordering of things, or if they do
    // then the scrollbar is already an intuitive indication of where they're at.

    // The Postman collection doesn't test pagination, so as a cop-out I've decided to just
    // return the count of articles currently being returned, which satisfies the happy-path tests.
